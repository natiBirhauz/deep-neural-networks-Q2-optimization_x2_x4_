Gradient Descent Implementation, Momentum Method Implementation And Advanced Optimization Methods
Exercise 0: Basic Gradient Descent Implementation
------------------------------------------------
In this exercise, you'll implement basic gradient descent for two functions:
x² and x⁴. This will help you understand the fundamental concepts of optimization.
Exercise 1: Momentum Method Implementation
----------------------------------------
Compare the convergence of standard gradient descent with the momentum method
for both x² and x⁴ functions.
Exercise 2: Advanced Optimization Methods
---------------------------------------
